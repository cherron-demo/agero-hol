# Snowflake Forecast, Call Transcript Analysis, and Image Classification Lab

## Overview

1. **Forecasting Demand for Subscriptions:**
   We want to understand how many total customers are likely to subscribe to a new account type for a bank. That will help us with revenue projections and staffing needs. To do this, we'll train a forecasting model then use it to generate predictions â€“ and evaluate the model to understand how accurate those predictions are likely to be.

2. **Call Transcript Analysis:**

   - **Step 1:** Run `data_setup.sql` to initialize the necessary objects for the lab.
   - **Step 2:** Run `utility.sql` to set up utility functions required for the lab.

3. **Image Classification:**
   After setting up the environment, proceed with the forecasting tasks outlined in the lab guide.
