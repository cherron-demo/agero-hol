--you need to parse JSONs to store each component of the score into a separate column and convert the scoring provided by the LLM into numeric format, so you can easily visualize it. Run the following query:

--In this step, you will visualize the scoring results on the map. Open Projects > Streamlit > + Streamlit App. Give the new app a name, for example Sentiment analysis - results, and pick ADVANCED_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC as an app location.
